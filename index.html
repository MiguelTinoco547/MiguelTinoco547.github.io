        <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome to my personal website! This space is dedicated to sharing my story and journey with you. My name is Miguel Tinoco, and Iâ€™m currently a third-year political science major with a deep focus on social justice, cultural anthropology, and the law, particularly immigration law. My experiences as a student, volunteer, and musician shape how I see the world and how I hope to impact it. Each page here offers a glimpse into the unique blend of interests, studies, and values that drive me daily. My goal in creating this site is to reflect on these paths and share ideas I hope will resonate, inspire, and challenge you to think deeply about your own journey.<br><br>

        Through this website, youâ€™ll see my academic pursuits in political science and cultural anthropology, which have been my framework for understanding society, justice, and global perspectives. The pages focused on my academic projects will explore ideas around race, culture, and community, often inspired by the experiences Iâ€™ve had and the people Iâ€™ve met along the way. My studies in anthropology allow me to see how cultural and generational differences shape discussions on race, and this viewpoint fuels my commitment to advocacy and awareness. This journey has led me to engage with social issues that matter deeply to me, from antiblackness and racial equality to immigration rights and access to fair legal representation, especially for vulnerable communities.<br><br>

        Beyond academics, youâ€™ll also find here a reflection of my personal life and hobbies. Music has been an anchor for me, offering an outlet for creativity and balance amidst the demands of college life. I play drums, guitar, and bass, and Iâ€™m eager to keep learning new instruments whenever I can. Iâ€™m also drawn to minimalism and sustainability, intrigued by the idea of living in a tiny house one day as a way to embrace simplicity. I believe that growth happens through learning and doing, so Iâ€™m constantly seeking ways to expand my skill set, from soft skills that enrich my personal interactions to coding skills that helped me bring this site to life. This website captures these different parts of me as they are now â€“ and as they continue to evolve.
